<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    JavaFX allows you to create Java applications with a modern, 
    hardware-accelerated user interface that is highly portable. 
</p>
<p>
    This tutorial will help you to write a JavaFX <span class="JFX_MAJOR">11</span> application and run it 
    on desktop platforms.
</p>
<p>

<p>
    JavaFX builds on top of JDK and is a standalone component. There are 2 different options for 
    developing JavaFX applications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/">JavaFX SDK</a></li>
    <li>Use a build system (e.g. maven/gradle) to download the required modules from Maven Central.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For both options, it is required to have a recent version of JDK <span class="JDK_MAJOR">11</span>, or at least JDK 11.
